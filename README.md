# Docker Cheat Sheet

## Why Docker? ##
1. **The same behaviour on different devices**  
With docker you can make sure that your code will show the same results on different devices and platforms.
2. **Publish your projects, and use other's projects**  
When a project is published on dockerhub, you can pull it easily  
also others can pull your projects

## Definitions : ##

**Docker Image**: the blueprint of the code, or the original code

**Docker Container**: the runtime instance of the Docker image

In real like, this looks like cars factory.  
**Docker Image** = **Car Factory**  
**Docker Container** = **Cars**  
There can be lots of cars, but we have a single car factory.  
And there can be **lots of** runtime **docker containers**
, but there can 
only be a **single Docker Image** for similar docker containers. 

**Dockerhub**: https://hub.docker.com/  
	a place to publish docker images, and 
use published docker images.

**DockerFile** : Used to create docker images
